# Introduction
    Hi, I am Rohan Prasen Kedari. This is the neural network that I created using Pytorch Library using python. This is used for image prediction.

## Technologies used
    I have used `miniconda` to create a deeplearning environment and to eradicate any version conflicts. I have used `Python 3.8` in this particular development of the code.

## Pre-requisites
    You have to install pytorch, torchvision, pillow and torch libraries using pip to be able to run the following code.

# Thanking Note
    Thanks for spending time on reviewing my code. Have a look at it by cloning the repo. Feel free to fork and contribute to the code. Kudos ðŸ˜„
