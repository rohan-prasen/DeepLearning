# Introduction
    Hi, I am Rohan Prasen Kedari. This is the neural network that I created using Pytorch Library using python. This is used for image prediction.
## Technologies used
    I have used `miniconda` to create a deeplearning environment and to eradicate any version conflicts. I have used `Python 3.8` in this particular development of the code.
